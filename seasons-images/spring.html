        <h1>Quotes</h1>

        <p><img src="spring.jpg" alt="Spring" title="Spring" class="yesbird">"When spring came, even the false spring, there were no problems except where to be happiest. The only thing that could spoil a day was people and if you could keep from making engagements, each day had no limits. People were always the limiters of happiness except for the very few that were as good as spring itself". -Ernest Hemingway</p>

        <p>"It's spring fever. That is what the name of it is. And when you've got it, you want—oh, you don't quite know what it is you do want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you want it so!” -Mark Twain.</p>
