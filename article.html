<h1>Article Review</h1>

<h2><a href="http://youtube.com">YOUTUBE</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>I think Youtube has always done a great job with their website set up and attracting people to it. You can easily type in what you want to watch in the search bar right up top and I like when you enter Youtube, it shows your subscribers have posted recently. It defiently gets annoying after awhile when it shows you videos that were posted a month ago or a fews ago. I would rather enjoy watching videos that are made pretty recently from people I subscribed too. I think it has the 1 col 2 col 3 col format because it shows in the first col the different topics or genres you can choose from. In the 2 col, there's videos that are recommend for you to watch and 3 col, has the home page, explore, short videos, subscriptions, and the library. I like the way they use their colors, it's defiently more spread out and even out. I think the red in the logo is perfect and I think using black & white gives a good presentation for the website. The website is very easy to navigate and was put together very well. It would be easy to understand for anyone who's new to Youtube.  </li>


<h3><a href="http://amazon.com">AMAZON</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>I think Amazon is a just a cool website in general because you can find anything you need on Amazon. I think it has a good layout for the website and everything is organized by category pretty well. I sometimes have a hard time finding specific ideas when looking through the categories but most of the time, I can just type whatever I need in the search bar. I believe it has the 1 col 2 col 3 col format which I think helps customers see the products easier. The website itself is just an easy website to navigate and is just very straightforward. The colors aren't too exciting but I think they fit for the website pretty well. Also, I like how they show you recent ideas you looked at before and ask if you want to pick up from where you left off from. That is defiently helpful if you wanted to still look at those items later or wanted to hold off from buying them for the moment.</li>



<h4><a href="http://craigslist.org">CRAIGSLIST</a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>I think Craigslist isn't the best website I've seen. It's very overwhelming and not organized at all. I would say Facebook Market Place is a better site when wanting to sell or buy a certain product. It's alot more organized and pleasing to look at. With Craigslist, it's all over the place and has a bunch of words just crammed together right when you get to the home screen. It's very crowded and hard to find what you're looking for. I would also say the website looks a little sketchy if you are new to the website. I guess it's a easy to use if you just go to the search bar and type in what you want but I think it would look better and be more approachable if it was organized and more straight to the point. There are no exciting colors beside blue and white which is kinda boring. If there were more colors and images it would be a better website. Everything throughout the whole website is the same format with the same fonts. You could say its consistant but maybe the website change it up and put more exciting and intreguing information on it. Also, it doesn't have the 1 col 2 col 3 col layout, it just has everything listed right after one of another.  </li>
