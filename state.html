<h1>Hosts Review</h1>

<h2><a href="http://delaware.gov">DELAWARE</a></h2>

  <p> This is my favorite website because it looks the most professional and doesn't look messy. I really like the logo on the website for Deleware. It has pretty easy access to everything that someone needs to figure out.  </p>

<h3><a href="http://alaska.gov">ALASKA</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>I like the pictures and details of Alaska's logo on the website. It could do better with font consistancy. There's alot going on with different fonts. There seems to be alot of information about Alaska but it could be better organized and less skattered. </p>


<h4><a href="http://myflorida.comg">MYFLORIDA</a></h4>
<ul>
  <p>I think the picture could be better quality and maybe choose a different kind of picture to present for the website. It doesn't seem to have alot of information on the website and it's super plain looking. </p>


<h5><a href="http://illinios.gov">ILLINOIS</a></h5>
<ul>
  <p> It's super boring and looks unprofessional. It could be better at presenting information and provide a little less information because it gets confusing after awhile. </p>


<h5><a href="http://nebraska.gov">NEBRASKA</a></h5>
<ul>
  <p> I think this website needs to have a better picture becauce its blurry and doesn't look professional. It could be more presentable and have more exciting colors. The grey makes it boring and not inviting.
